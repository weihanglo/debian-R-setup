favorite movie into your DVD. \nAlmost all modern operation systems have som built-in disc burner. \nTo create your own bootable device, follow the approaches below:\n\nFor Windows: built-in disc burner\nFor Mac OSX: built-in method\nFor Linux: built-in application in Gnome Desktop Environment\n\nFinally, your CD/DVD turns into a \"bootable device\".\nCreate a bootable USB driver\nIf you do not have any blank CD at hand, you can use an USB stick as a bootable device.\n\nDownload UNetbootin.\nStart UNetbootin and select the installation diskimage you've downloaded.\nSelect Type as USB Drive\nSelect Drive as where your USB stick mounted.\nClick OK.\n\n\nAfter the process completes, you will get a reusable bootable USB stick.\nSet the BIOS Booting Priority\nBIOS is a built-in firmware to perform hardware initialization during \nstartup on PC. One of its functions is to select which devices are potential \nbootable devices, and in which order booting from them will be attempted. Thus, \nyou should configure your bootable device first for the boot priority. \n\nA modern BIOS setup utility can accessed by pressing a certain key \non the keyboard when the PC starts. Usually the key is advertised for short \ntime during the early startup, for example \"Press F2 for Setup Menu.\".\n\n\n\nThen switch to Boot tab.\n\n\n\nSelect your bootable USB stick as 1st Boot Device.\n\n\nOnce your computer restarts, it will boot using your new boot order priority.  \nNOTE: While different computers use different BIOS keys and have different BIOS layouts, the process is similar on most computers.\n"},"doc/install_debian.html":{"url":"doc/install_debian.html","title":"Install Debian","keywords":"","body":"Install Debian\n\nDebian is a Unix-like computer operating system that is composed \nentirely of free software, most of which is under the GNU General Public \nLicense (GPL), and packaged by a group of individuals known as the Debian Project. \nThree main branches are offered: Stable, Testing and Unstable.(from wikipedia)\n"},"doc/install_os.html":{"url":"doc/install_os.html","title":"Install Debian Operation System","keywords":"","body":"Install Debian Operation System\nHere comes the most important part of this manual.

Assumed that you are going to setup a server for R computing.\nYou want to mix a 5 TB HDD and a 1 GB SSD for these two aims:  \n\nSpeed up your system: as much commonly used data as possible stays on the SSD.\nKeep volatile data off the SSD to reduce wear.\n\nA scheme would be like this:\n\nSSD: /boot, / (root), /usr\nHDD: /var, /home, /tmp, swap\n\nThe recommended size of the partitions:\n\n/boot : 200 - 500 MB \nFor store multiple kernels/boot images, around 350 MB of partition size is sufficient.\n/ (root) : > 20 GB\nTraditionally, / (root) contains the [/usr][/usr] directory, which can grow significantly depending on how much softwares installed (softwares installed in /usr usually be shared among all users.)\n\n/var : 8-15 GB \nThis partition may contain mails, cache, and other user programs and daemon. Seperate it from / (root) can reduce danger and wear of your SDD.\n\n/tmp: > 2 GB\nThis partition stored temporary files. For instance, your downloaded a Debian DVD image via Firefix with open option. It would download to /tmp. If you are going to do simulation with lots of temporary output files, you can save them inside /tmp. The recommanded size is not less 2 GB.\n\nswap : [varies] \nSwap area is so called virtual memory. The old general rule for swap partition size was to allocate twice the amount of physical RAM. If a sufficient amount of your physical RAM is available, it is possible to have a smaller partition size of swap area.\n\n/home : [varies] \nIt is typically where user data, downloads, and multimedia reside. On a desktop system, /home is typically the largest filesystem on the drive.\n\n\nClick more if you want to learn more about partitions and directory tree.\nFinally, your partition table may look like this:\n  SCSI1 (0,0,0) (sda) - 1.0 GB VBOX VIRTUAL SSD\n        #1 primary  500.0 MB  B  f  ext4  /boot\n        #2 primary    5.0 GB     f  ext4  / \n        #5 logical  100.0 GB     f  ext4  /usr\n\n  SCSI2 (1,0,0) (sdb) - 5.0 TB VBOX HARDDISK GPT\n        #1 primary   30.0 GB     f  ext4  /var\n        #2 primary  100.0 GB     f  swap  swap\n        #3 primary   20.0 GB     f  ext4  /tmp\n        #4 primary    4.0 TB     f  ext4  /home\n        #5            0.7 TB        FREE SPACE\n\nSetup Partition\nATTENTION: If you expect to resize your partition in the future, then you \nneed a more flexible way to manage your partitions. Here comes LVM (Logical \nVolume Manager) to save your time and life.  \n\nManual partition disks. Select which disk to be parted.\n\n\n\nCreate new partition table.

Should create /boot first for setting bootloader.\n\n\n\nTurn on bootflag for /boot partition. Then write changes to disks.\n\n\nSkip the Configuration of Package Manager\nA well developed Package Manager can be the soul of a linux distribution, \nbring much convenience to download open-source software in minimum typing \nstrokes.

As same as scp command, rsync can simply transfer data via ssh/rsh. More over, rsync itself can also be a daemon if needing for lower CPU overhead and faster transfer rate.\nTwo different way for use rsync to contact a remote system\n1. Using a remote-shell program as the transport (ssh/rsh):\nRemote-shell transport format would be familiar to you. A single colon (:)\nseparate a host specification and source/destination path.\nTo sync files from remote to local is just like cp/scp:\n$ rsync user@hostname:path/to/file /path/to/syncfile\n\nOr backup to remote\n$ rsync /path/to/file user@hostname:path/to/syncfile\n\nIf you use non-default port for your remote-shell program, or want to add some \ndifferent feature while transfer via ssh/rsh, just add specified remote-shell \ncommand after -e option:\n$ rsync -e 'ssh -p 10022' user@hostname:path/to/syncfile\n\n2. Contacting an rsync daemon directly via TCP\nA rsync daemon is mostly used when your want to constantly maintain a synchronization. It can save some CPU usage and speedup transfer rate a bit.\nTo use rsync daemon for sync, a double colon (::) is required to separate the host specification and the module, or using rsync:// schema. Using double colon almost the same as single colon. The only difference is the module parameter. We will cover it later.\nThe default rsync daemon TCP port typically using 873.\n$ rsync user@hostname::module /path/to/syncfile\n\nHowever, rsync daemon would not encrypt data while transfering by default, you should manually encrypt by ssh command as your needs. (Encryption may lower some speed, but is necessary when connecting to internet.)\n$ rsync -e 'ssh' user@hostname::path/to/file /path/to/syncfile\n\nThe rsync schema is another way to do the same thing:\n# Example for rsync:// schema\n# rsync [OPTION]... rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]/MODULE[/SRC] [DEST]\nrsync rsync:///module /path/to/your/copyfile\n\nATTENTAION!! : \nrsync has a trick that if the source path without an trailling slash, it would create a directory with the same name inside the destination directory. Otherwise, it would only sync files inside source directory.\n# This will sync files with the directory.\nrsync /directory-no-slash /path/to/store/a/new/directory\n\n# This will sync files under the directory.\nrsync /directory-no-slash/ /path/to/store/some/new/files\n\nUseful rsync options\nHere are some common options for rsync\n\n-a : archive mode, the same as using -rlptgoD.\n-r : rescursive\n-l : copies symlinks as symlinks\n-p : preserves permissions \n-t : preserves modification times\n-g : preserves group\n-o : preserves owner\n-D : preserves device files\n\n\n-A : preserves ACLs (A more specific access rights table. See wiki.)\n-H : preserves hard links\n-S : handle sparse files efficiently\n-X : preserves extended attributes\n-v : increase verbosity (can add up to tree -vvv for the most verbosity)\n-x : don't cross file-system boundaries (A filesystem boundary is a mount point. See more!)\n-z : compress data during the transfer\n--delete : differential clean-up during sync, like a mirror backup\n--numeric-ids : do not map uid/gid values by user/group name\n--progress : show the transfer progress during\n--password-file=**FILE** : read rsync-daemon-access password from this FILE\n\nFollowing rsync combined with options is the most usefule combination I've used.\nrsync -aHAXzxv --numeric-ids --delete --progress -e \"ssh -T -o Compression=no -x\" [USER@]HOST:[SOURCE] [DEST]\nRsync daemon\nAs mentioned above, using rsync daemon have a bit advantage when sync constantly. To setup a rsync daemon is as simple as setting up a ssh server. For convenience, We will explian how to setup a daemon with a Network-attached Storage in the next chapter.\n"},"doc/backup_rsync-daemon.html":{"url":"doc/backup_rsync-daemon.html","title":"Setting Rsync Daemon","keywords":"","body":"Setting rsync daemon\nWe already leared about the powerful rsync for transferring files. Now, we will implement rsync on a Network-attached Storage (NAS). Assumed we have two server2 and one NAS. All these devices is connected with each other via local area network (LAN). \nThe port mapping is as following:\n\nserver1: 192.168.0.1\nserver2: 192.168.0.2\nmyNAS:  192.168.0.3\n\nAnd we have two different to backup files from servers seperately. (though volumes can be the same partition technically)\n\nserver1 /home/ -----> sync to NAS /volumes/server1\nserver2 /home/important -----> sync to NAS /volumes/server2/important\n\n0. What is NAS?\nNAS is just an self-contained, file-level storage server connected to a network. It is actually a tiny computer that powered with some abilities to store and aceess files more elegantly. In this manual, we would use the Synology's NAS for example.\nBefore we start, you must setup all the volume, RAID, and other stuff in your NAS. Synology's product have a decent web-base operating system called DiskStation Manager (DSM). You can read their documents to get started.\n1. Enable rsync daemon via operating system of your NAS\nFirst, login DSM. Open the Control Panel, then select File Services.\n\n\nCheck the Enable rsync service field.\n\nThen, add your super user as a rsync account to enable rsync daemon access.\n\n2. Write your own rsyncd.conf\nAfter previous steps, NAS start rsyncd daemon automatically for you. The rest you have to do is specify different setting between servers. \nWhile we enable rsync in NAS DSM, we also enable ssh via TCP port 22 by default. However, the ssh service on NAS system is only for local network usage. We would keep it in LAN. No port forwardgin to WAN.\nThus, if we want to ssh-login NAS system, we need to use either a device in the same LAN.\n# Login in NAS system via **server1**\nuser@server1$ ssh user@192.168.0.3\n\n...\n\n# Logged in NAS\nuser@myNAS$\n\nNext, open the rsync configure file /etc/rsyncd.conf.\nuser@myNAS$ sudo vim /etc/rsyncd.conf\n\nHere are a example rsyncd.conf file:\n#---------------------------------------\n# global parameters\n#---------------------------------------\n\n#motd file = /etc/rsyncd.motd\nlog file = /var/log/rsyncd.log          # file storing logs\npid file = /var/run/rsyncd.pid          # file recording their process ID\nlock file = /var/run/rsync.lock         # file to ensure separation of two instance of a program\n\nauth users = user, root                 # local users that can connect to a rsync daemon\nuid = root                              # ID of the user that executes rsync daemon\ngid = root                              # group Id of the user's group executing rsync daemon\nuse chroot = no                         # if true, will *chroot* to the path.

We allow only LAN-side IP for security issue\n\n[server2-important]\ncomment = Back Up Module for server2 important files\npath = /volumes/server2\nhosts allow = 192.168.11.103            # a module a host to avoid accidentally sync the wrong remote\nAfter finishing configure rsyncd.conf, you should create secrets file at the path you specified. Assumed you set the path at /etc/rsyncd.secrets. Open it.\nuser@myNAS$ sudo vim /etc/rsyncd.secrets\n\nThen follow the username:password pattern for the authentication. For security issue, try to avoid using the same password as the server account.\nuser:mypassword\nroot:rootHasItsOwnPassword\nAnd the important part. You should use chmod to change access for the secrets file, otherwise rsyncd wont be able to work.\n# only file owner can read/write the file\nuser@myNAS$ sudo chmod 600 /etc/rsyncd.secrets\n\nAt last, check there isn't any process running. Then reboot you NAS (Maybe there is another way to restart rsync daemon, but I have no idea with Synology DSM.)\n"},"doc/backup_scheduled-task.html":{"url":"doc/backup_scheduled-task.html","title":"Create Scheduled Tasks to Sync","keywords":"","body":"Create Scheduled Tasks to Sync\nFinished the server-side mission. Let's turn to client side!\ncrontab for simple scheduled tasks\nTask on the client side is relatively simple. Just need to schedule some commands for automatically synchronizing your data. In a GNU/Linux system, there is a program called cron. It is a program that schedule task for us. As for scheduling task, it is also a daemon tool for many routines. To create cron jobs, we use crontab command to write down on cron table.\nBefore we started, let's learn some few options in crontab.\n\n-u : specify a user's cron table to use. Must has the permissions.\n-l : list a user's cron tabls\n-r : remove cron\n-e : edit current user's cron table if no using -u\n\nFor example:\n\nopening and modifying on cron table for user2\n  $ sudo crontab -u user2 -e\n\n\nremove cron tabls for user1\n  $ sudo crontab -u user1 -r\n\n\n\n1. write a rsync script\nSince crontab can only execute one line command in a task, we should write down our own Bash Script for multiple commands.\nFirst, create a script wherever you want. (maybe at /home/user/cron_scripts)\n$ vim ~/crom_scripts/rsync-backup.sh\n\nIn the rsync-backup.sh file, backup using rsync.\n#!/bin/bash\n# Modified Time: Sun Apr 24 17:00:00 CST 2016\n# Author: john doe (john_doe@example.com)\n# Usage: Synchronize data to NAS\n\necho Start rsync backup at $(date).\"\n\nrsync -axvzHSX --numeric-ids --progress --delete --password-file=/etc/rsyncd.cli.secrets /home/ rsync://user@192.168.1.101/server1\n\necho End rsync backup at $(date).\"\n\nYou may consider why there is anoterh password file again. The password file contain only a password corresponding to the rsyncd.secrets file you created in the NAS server-side before. For instance, if you have a rsyncd.secrets file with the contents such as,\nuser:mypassword\nroot:rootHasItsOwnPassword\nand you want to login with user account, you must create a file containing only the password mypassword. Still, this is a plain text file, so you must change its permission to 600 by the chmod command as same as what you done to rsyncd.secrets before.\n2. Scheduling your tasks\nAfter write your automated scripts. Open and modify cron tables by crontab\n$ sudo crontab -e\n\nTo create a schedules are easy, just follow its clear syntax and enjoy the amazing automatic tasks.\nCrontab syntax :\nA crontab file has five fields specifying the interval and one field containing the one-line command to be executed.\nTo define the time you can provide concrete values for minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon), and day of week (dow) or use * in these fields (for any).\n*    *    *    *    *    command to be executed\n-    -    -    -    -\n|    |    |    |    |\n|    |    |    |    +----- day of week (0 - 7) (Sunday=0,7)\n|    |    |    +------- month (1 - 12)\n|    |    +--------- day of month (1 - 31)\n|    +----------- hour (0 - 23)\n+------------- min (0 - 59)\n\nFor example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts at 5 a.m every Monday:\n#m   h   dom  mon  dow   command\n0    5    *    *    1     tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/¬\n\nOr you want to repeat the command every four hours:\n#m   h   dom  mon  dow   command\n0   */4   *    *    *     sudo apt-get update\n\nFinally, set your own cron jobs to your rsync script. Remember, using Absolute path to the script is always better than relative path. This cron will execute at 8:00 A.M every Monday and Thursday.\n#m   h   dom  mon  dow   command\n0    8    *    *   1,4    ~/cron_scripts/rsync-backup.sh\n\n"},"doc/other.html":{"url":"doc/other.html","title":"Other Configuration","keywords":"","body":"Other Configurations\nHere are some minor configuration tips you may want to know.\n\nPort Forwarding\nNginx and Shiny Server\n\n"},"doc/other_portmapping.html":{"url":"doc/other_portmapping.html","title":"Port Mapping","keywords":"","body":"Configure Port Forwarding on a Router\nTo forward ports, you first need to understand about what your router does.\nYour router has a function called Network Address Translation, or NAT, built-in. Inside your network, computers get their own addresses like 192.168.1.100. These addresses are called \"private\" or \"reserved\" addresses which automatically assigned by your home router via DHCP. A computers can communicate with router and with each other via its own address.\nHowever, these \"private\" addresses could only be recognized within private network. It will be failed if others want to connect to a specific computer via an address like 192.163.1.100. Therefore, we should change it from the private IP of the computer to the public IP of the router. This is so called the port forwarding.\nConfiguration of port forwarding often varies from routers to routers. In this munual, we would use D-Link for demonstration.\n\nUse your favorite browser to visit \"192.168.0.1\" to connect to your D-Link router.\n\n\n\nSelect Network Setting at the sidebar. Then scroll to Add New DHCP Reservation.\n\n\n\nAdd a new DHCP reservation for your server's IP. Remember to save your configuration.\n\n\n\nWait for seconds.

NGINX powers many top sites, such as Netflix, Airbab, and Github.\nIn this topic, you will learn how to configure a simple HTTP server and a reverse proxy server for R-shiny with NGINX.\nInstallation\nTo download and install NGINX. Execute the following commands.\n$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nginx\n\nTo verify your installation, access http://your-ip-address. You should see the default nginx page like below (if port forwarding is configured correctly).\n\nSimple Configuration\nSimple commands for start/stop/restart NGINX server.\n$ sudo service nginx stop\n$ sudo service nginx start\n$ sudo service nginx restart\n\nTo make sure that NGINX server will restart automatically after rebooted, execute this:\nsudo update-rc.d nginx defaults\n\nHTTP Server Configuration\nNGINX's configuration capabilities are extensive and flexible. Thus, we will focus on simple HTTP server configuration for static content in this section.\nTo configure your server, open /etc/nginx/nginx.conf. This is the global config file of NGINX.\n$ vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n\nNext, find the server block within http block, there may be some example or default setting in the block.\nhttp {\n\n  # other config blocks...\n\n  server {\n    # some configuration\n    # set your config here\n  }\n}\nNow, let our server listen on the default TCP port 80. Do not forget the trailing semicolon.\nserver {\n  listen 80;\n}\nThe default root folder of the web server is /var/www/html. To change files in this path, you should always be a sudoer. For convenience sake, we will change the root path to the home directory of the web server administrator.\nFirst, create a folder www-data in your web admin's home directory and a subfolder named www-data in it. After that, create a new folder in the www-data that named as the domain name/hostname of you server.\n$ mkdir -p /home/a-web-admin/www-data/\n$ cd /home/a-web-admin/www-data\n$ mkdir example.domain\n\nNext, add a server_name and a root parameters into NGINX config file.\nserver {\n  listen 80;\n\n  server_name example.domain;\n  root /home/a-web-admin/www-data/example.domain/;\n\n}\nFinally, to handle request from clients, add location block inside the server block.\nAdd the following location block to the server block:\nlocation / {\n\n}\nThis location block specifies the / prefix compared with the URI from the request. The URI will be added to the root for fetching local data under the root concatenate with / path.\nThat is, a http://example.domain/image.png request may try to get an image right under you /home/a-web-admin/www-data/example.domain/image.png if exists.\nIf you add another location like below:\nlocation /image/ {\n  # other configuration...\n}\nThe requests such as http://example.domain/image/something.jpg would try to get file with the path home/a-web-admin/www-data/example.domain/image/something.jpg.\nFor further basic configuration, see NGINX Official Tutorial.\nR Shiny server with NGINX\nR Shiny is a web application framework that can turn analyses into web applications without any web knowledge.\nIn this section, we will learn how to configure a Shiny server with the power of NGINX.\nInstall and Configure The Shiny Server\n provides a convenient way to install and configure your R-shiny server. However, we would do some trick to combine Shiny and NGINX.\nFirst, install shiny package for R.\n$ sudo su - \\\n-c \"R -e \\\"install.packages('shiny', repos='https://cran.rstudio.com/')\\\"\"\n\nBecause RStudio company only provides Shiny server of Ubuntu version, we will use this Ubuntu version temporarily.\n$ sudo apt-get install gdebi-core\n$ wget https://download3.rstudio.org/ubuntu-12.04/x86_64/shiny-server-1.4.2.786-amd64.deb\n$ sudo gdebi shiny-server-1.4.2.786-amd64.deb\n\nThe default port for R-Shiny server is 3838. That means any can connect to the server through the URL http://:3838.\nSimple commands for start/stop/restart your shiny-server.\n$ sudo systemctl start shiny-server\n$ sudo systemctl stop shiny-server\n$ sudo systemctl restart shiny-server\n\nThe default configure file for shiny-server locates at /etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf file. This config file use nearly same syntax and parameters as NGINX config file. For example, if you want to change the default port to 13838, modify it as below;\nserver {\n  listen 13838;\n  # other configuration...\n}\nShiny Server administration document explains lots of features clearly. We will only show some useful config in this tutorial.\nFirst, create a new account to manage all Shiny apps.\n$ sudo adduser shinyapps\n\n# Then, login as shinyapps. Create a root folder to manage apps.\n\n$ mkdir -p ~/ShinyApps/\n\nHere is the example configuration file at /etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf.\nserver {\n  listen 3838;\n\n  # For root shiny server (in shinyapps user home folder)\n  location / {\n\n    # The shiny-server process would run by user `shinyapps`\n    run_as shinyapps;\n\n    # Save logs here\n    log_dir /var/log/shiny-server;\n\n    # Path to shiny server for separate apps\n    site_dir /home/shinyapps/ShinyApps;\n\n    # List contents of a (non-Shiny-App) directory when clients visit corresponding URIs\n    directory_index on;\n  }\n\n  # Allow users to host their own apps in `~/ShinyApps`\n  location /users {\n    run_as :HOME_USER:;\n    user_dirs;\n  }\n}\nTo test your configs, put your Shiny apps in ~/ShinyApps/. Assumed the hierarchy of your shiny app looks like this,\nmyapps/\n├── server.R\n└── ui.R\n\nYou should move your app folder into ~/ShinyApps/ directory such as ~/ShinyApps/myapps/.\nFinally, use a web browser to open http://localhost:3838/myapps/. If you can connect to your app, the shiny server is successfully installed and working.\nAdd Configurations to NGINX for Shiny Server\nIf you want to combine Shiny Server with NGINX HTTP Server. Here is the example configuration of NGINX.\nserver {\n  # Other locations and configurations...\n\n  location /shiny/ { # shiny server will locate at `http://example.domain/shiny/`\n    rewrite ^/shiny/(.*)$ /$1 break;\n    proxy_pass http://localhost:3838;\n    proxy_redirect http://localhost:3838/ $scheme://$host/shiny/;\n    proxy_http_version 1.1;\n    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n    proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;\n    proxy_read_timeout 20d;\n  }\n}\nIf your shiny server serves at port 3838, NGINX will pass the request to your shiny server. Then\nredirect the URL as something like http://example.domain/shiny/you-apps/.\nOther tips\n\nFor more NGINX configuration, see this resource.\nFor more Shiny server configs, see this guide.\n\n"}}}
